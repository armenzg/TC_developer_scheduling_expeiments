# TaskCluster scheduling experiments
This is a repository only to share some code that tests that you can schedule tasks and graphs on pushes owned by armenzg. It is not a project meant to last.
The project will open a web page and ask you to authenticate through TaskCluster' login.

# How to use it
1. Create a virtualenv and activate it
2. python setup.py develop
3. Decide which script to run; their names make it clear what they do
