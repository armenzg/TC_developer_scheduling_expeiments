# TC_developer_scheduling_expeiments
This is a repository only to share some code that tests that you can schedule tasks and graphs on pushes owned by armenzg. It is not a project meant to last.

# How to use
1 - Create a virtualenv and activate it
2 - python setup.py develop
3 - Decide which script to run; their names make it clear what they do
